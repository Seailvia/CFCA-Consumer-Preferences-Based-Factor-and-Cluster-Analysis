## Research Objectives  
1. Analyze consumer survey data to identify key factors influencing preferences for mountain wines.  
2. Use factor analysis (Principal Components Factor Analysis) to reduce data dimensionality.  
3. Apply clustering methods (Ward’s Method and K-means) to segment consumers into distinct groups.  
4. Develop targeted marketing strategies based on consumer segment characteristics.  


## Methodology  
### 1. Data Collection  
- Survey of 260 consumers on sociodemographics, behaviors, and attitudes toward mountain wines.  
- 15 variables measuring product preferences and environmental views.  

### 2. Analytical Techniques  
#### Factor Analysis  
- **Principal Components Factor Analysis (PCFA)**: Transforms variables into uncorrelated components to capture variance.  
- Identified 2 main factors:  
  - Factor 1: Familiarity with mountain wine attributes (e.g., rarity, regionality)  
  - Factor 2: Environmental consciousness  

#### Clusteri{insert\_element\_0\_}ng  
- **Ward’s Method**: Hierarchical clustering to minimize within-cluster variance.  
- **K-means Clustering**: Refines clusters using initial centroids from Ward’s method.  
- Elbow method determined 3 optimal clusters.  


## Key Findi{insert\_element\_1\_}ngs  
### Consumer Segments  
1. **Cluster 1: Environmentally Responsible Consumers**  
   - High environmental awareness, moderate interest in product attributes.  
   - Older demographic, higher willingness to pay (mean bid: 2.87).  

2. **Cluster {insert\_element\_2\_}2: Product-Attribute Focused Consumers**  
   - Strong appreciation for mountain wine characteristics, lower environmental concern.  
   - Younger demographic, lower payment willingness (mean bid: 1.92).  

3. **Cluster {insert\_element\_3\_}3: Low Interest Consumers**  
   - Low engagement with both product attributes and environmental issues.  
   - Lowest payment willingness (mean bid: 1.25).  

### Key Insig{insert\_element\_4\_}hts  
- Environmental responsibility and age correlate with higher purchase intent.  
- Target marketing should prioritize Cluster 1 as primary consumers and engage Cluster 2 through environmental education.
